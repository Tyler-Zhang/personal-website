      <h1 class="row col">Screen Tick</h1>
      <br/>
      <p>
        Screen Tick is a project that was originally conceived under the name
        <a href="https://github.com/Tyler-Zhang/ScreenOff">ScreenOff</a> at a highschool hackathon called MasseyHacks. We thought that children being distracted on their phones
        is a big problem. We wanted to create a tool that could track when and how long they were on their phones for. That
        way, their parents could know that their children are not distracted when doing their homework or even driving.
      </p>

      <p style="margin-bottom:0px !important">
        <b>We realized that this was a big project to take on because it needed:</b>
      </p>
      <ol>
        <li>A backend server to receive, store, and format data</li>
        <li>An Android application to track data and send to server</li>
        <li>A web app to display data</li>
      </ol>
      <br/>

      <p>
        Unfortunately we didn’t have a working demo by the end.
      </p>


      <p>
        A few months later, I decided to challenge myself to see if I could finish the project single handedly. I rewrote all of
        the code from scratch and gained an enormous amount of knowledge.
      </p>

      <h2 class="top-padding-sm">Backend Server</h2>
      <br/>

      <p>
        The backend is written in Node.js. I chose the language because it was trendy, and I wanted to improve my novice level understanding
        of Javascript. I used
        <b>Express</b> for the routing and
        <b>MongoDB</b> as the database solution. Instead of using Mongoose as an ORM, I used the Node.js MongoDB driver so I
        could learn the low level APIs.
      </p>

        <div class="col">
          <img class="img-fluid" src="images/screentick/screentick-database.png" alt="Screentick bar charts">
        </div>
      </div>
      <br/>

      <p>
        By using these relations, each parent could have an account which would contain multiple users (their children) which will
        have multiple devices (phones, laptops, etc.). Although a lot of this data is relational, it made sense to use a
        NoSQL storage solution since there were a lot of one-to-many relations that would have to be joined..
      </p>

      <p>
        The primary method of adding devices to accounts is through the scanning of a QR code but to be compatible with devices with
        no camera, I also implemented joining accounts through a short text code (like in Discord). These codes are stored
        in the joinCodes table and are deleted when they expire.
      </p>

      <h2 class="top-padding-sm">Web App</h2>
      <br/>

      <p>
        The web app was initially created without the use of any frameworks. I soon got addicted to the drug that was React and decided
        to rewrite the front end codebase in React. Thankfully, it did not take too long since most HTMLis valid React JSX.
      </p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
          <img class="img-fluid" src="images/screentick/screentick-barchart.png" alt="Screentick bar charts">
        </div>
      </div>
      <br/>

      <p>
        This bar chart shows the amount of time a device’s screen has been on per hour. You can also select the day and view a range
        of days. Checkout the
        <a href="https://screentick.tylerzhang.com/">demo</a>.
      </p>


      <h2 class="top-padding-sm">Authentication</h2>
      <br/>

      <p>
        Authentication is done using JSON web tokens. I only store the id of the account in the JWT as a means of fast authentication.
        The JWT is saved as a cookie and is sent with every request.
      </p>


      <h2 class="top-padding-sm">Managing Devices</h2>
      <br/>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col">
          <img class="img-fluid" src="images/screentick/screentick-devices.png" alt="Screentick bar charts">
        </div>
      </div>
      <br/>

      <p>
        The user section allows the adding and deleting of devices
      </p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <img class="img-fluid" src="images/screentick/screentick-app1.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <img class="img-fluid" src="images/screentick/screentick-app2.png" alt="">
        </div>
        <div class="col-md-4">
          <img class="img-fluid" src="images/screentick/screentick-app3.png" alt="">
        </div>
      </div>

      <br/>

      <p>
        Devices can be added to the account by scanning the QRCode and choosing the owner of the device
      </p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-md-4 offset-md-4">
          <img class="img-fluid" src="images/screentick/screentick-app5.png" alt="">
        </div>
      </div>
      <br/>

      <p>
        The app runs a service in background that is automatically started when the device is turned on. The service listens for
        system broadcasts about screen state to calculate how long the phone has been on for. Data is initially stored on
        the device in a SQLite database and synced to the server every 15 minutes.
      </p>

      <h2 class="top-padding-sm">Lessons Learned</h2>
      <br/>

      <p style="margin-bottom:20px !important;">
        This project got me started on the right track as a Full-Stack Developer. Because it required a lot of different components,
        completing it taught me many skills like:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>How to develop front end applications using React and Redux</li>
        <li>Creating a server using Node.js and Express</li>
        <li>Using MongoDB including its awesome aggregation pipeline</li>
        <li>Android Development with Android Studio and React Native</li>
        <li>Authentication (using Bcrypt, Cookies, JWTs)</li>
      </ul>

      <h2 class="top-padding-sm">Things that can be improved</h2>
      <br/>

      <ul>
        <li>Rewrite the project in Typescript</li>
        <li>API design, make the API more restful and use Express routers more liberally</li>
        <li>Rewrite using an ORM like Mongoose or Typeorm</li>
        <li>Rewrite frontend using a better UI framework like AntDesign or Material</li>
        <li>Redesign Android App to use React-Native exclusively (it’s a hybrid right now)</li>
      </ul>
